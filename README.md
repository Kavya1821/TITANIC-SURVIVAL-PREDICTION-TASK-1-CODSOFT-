Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. By leveraging data analysis techniques and classification algorithms, the project aims to identify key factors that influenced survival rates, such as age, gender, class, and other demographic attributes.
Key Components
Data Collection & Preprocessing 🗂️
I utilized the Titanic dataset, which contains detailed information on passengers, including socio-economic status and survival status. Before feeding this data into the model, it was cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering 🛠️
The features were carefully selected to ensure the model can capture the critical patterns affecting survival. Variables like passenger class, sex, and age were highlighted as significant factors. Additional features, such as family size, were created to provide further insights into the data.
Model Selection & Training 🤖
Multiple machine learning algorithms were employed, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest classifiers, to assess their performance in predicting survival. Cross-validation was used to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation & Metrics 📊
The performance of the models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results were analyzed to select the best-performing model, ensuring both high accuracy and generalization to unseen data.
Conclusion & Insights 💡
The analysis showed that factors such as being a female passenger, higher socio-economic class, and younger age significantly increased the chances of survival. This project successfully demonstrates the practical application of machine learning to real-world datasets, providing valuable insights and predictions.
